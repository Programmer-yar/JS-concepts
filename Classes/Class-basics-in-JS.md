# Prototypal Inheritance
- In classical inheritance you can subclass from existing class. The child class inherits attributes and methods from parent class as in Java, C++ etc
- JS does not follow **classical inheritance**
- JavaScript follows **prototypal Inheritance** an object “inherits” properties from another object via the prototype linkage.
